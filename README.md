# MVVV-C

MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) is a design pattern that can be used to structure iOS applications written in Swift. The pattern is a combination of the traditional MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and the Coordination pattern.

Model: The model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for fetching, storing and manipulating the data.

View: The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It communicates with the ViewModel to get the data and displays it to the user.

ViewModel: The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It retrieves the data from the Model and prepares it for display in the View. It also handles any user interactions and updates the Model accordingly.

Coordinator: Coordinators are responsible for navigation and flow control in the application. They handle the transition between different screens and pass data between them.

The MVVM-C pattern helps to separate concerns and make the code more modular and testable. It also allows for a cleaner separation of the UI and business logic, making it easier to maintain and extend the application over time


# Resolver

A resolver is a tool used for dependency injection in Swift. It is responsible for creating and managing the dependencies between different parts of the application.

Dependency injection is a technique where the dependencies of a class are passed in through its initializer, rather than being created within the class itself. This allows for more flexibility and easier testing, as the dependencies can be easily swapped out with mock objects during testing.

A resolver is typically implemented as a singleton that holds a mapping of protocol or interface types to concrete implementations. When a class needs an instance of a dependency, it asks the resolver to provide it. The resolver then looks up the appropriate implementation and returns it.

In order to use a resolver in your project, you will need to define the protocols for your dependencies and register the concrete implementations with the resolver. You can then use the resolver to create instances of the dependencies when needed.

It's important to keep in mind that Dependency injection is just one of the several design patterns that could be applied in iOS development, so it might not be the best fit for all the projects. There are several other libraries available that can help with dependency injection such as Swinject, Dip and Typhoon.

# SPM

SPM (Swift Package Manager) is a dependency manager for Swift projects. It allows you to easily manage the dependencies of your project by specifying them in a Package.swift file.

To use SPM in your Xcode project, you will first need to create a Package.swift file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the dependencies for your project, including the package name, version and url for the package repository.

You can then add the dependencies to your project by specifying them in the dependencies section of the Package.swift file.
